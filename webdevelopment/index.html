        <p>This site serves as both a creative portfolio and professional resume, featuring my work with Mizzou Women’s Basketball and freelance visual media projects. This site will highlight my experiences, creativity, and passion for visual storytelling. </p>
        <h3>Purpose & Goals</h3>
        <p>	The purpose behind this website is to provide a platform to highlight my growth as a creative and document my professional journey while working toward future goals in the industry. Current goals consist of growing my personal brand as a creative pursuing freelance photography and videography opportunities. Developing my style of storytelling, especially within the sports context, is an area I am constantly seeking growth in as I experiment with new approaches and find meaningful ways to capture the emotion and details of each moment. Finding new inspiration and always seeking to expand my way of thinking is essential when it comes to my creative mindset and approaching any new project. </p>
