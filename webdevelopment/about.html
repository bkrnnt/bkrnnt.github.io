	<h1>About me!</h1>
		<!-- sample heading -->
		<p>		My name is Brooke Reutter, and I am a student majoring in Communication with an emphasis in Media at the University of Missouri. I work as a lead videography intern for the Mizzou Women’s Basketball team with freelance experience in photography and videography as well. I’m working toward a creative career that uses visual storytelling to help bring meaningful missions to life. Throughout my time with the women’s basketball program, I have been able to craft skills such as creative problem-solving, attention to detail, concept development, and collaboration/adaptability. Outside of Mizzou, I have worked various freelancing events such as the Sophie Cunningham Classic, OSG Midwest Regional Qualifier, concerts, weddings, engagements, and more. Taking opportunities to work in numerous different settings and environments has allowed me to expand my creative thinking and constantly seek new inspiration. I hope my future involves collaborating with people and organizations that value creativity and storytelling as a tool for meaningful impact and engagement. </p>
